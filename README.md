This application is designed with a built in browser.
This application's image recognition is based on finding several pixels (non-adjacent pixels) on a small image and then comparing the same patern of pixels in the picture that the program took a screenshot of.
# This application is NOT finished, some of the techniques are a bit above my compehension.

This type of application was already completed by another user who now charges monthly fee for the program, also a friend of mine completed the program and gave me a copy of his work and honestly it is much better than the one that another program is charging for his.

What works:
-print screen, but I cant figure out why it is taking print of a whole screen and not the form... probably a silly mistake that I am not seeing...
-image comparison and the location of where the image was located on the (X,Y) coordinate
-automatic clicking based on the small image lenth and width, then cutting the numbers in half and clicking right in the middle of the image. Since the print screen is not working like I want it to, I canot work on a plan to reduce the image recognition scan time.

What still needs progress
-provide the print screen to only take screens at specific parts of the screen to reduce scanning through worthless pixels.
-provide the program works in the background.
-provide the program with an automatic keyboard to log into the game every time.
-provide the program so that it doesnt need to open IE in order to put in login information.
-some images are too small to work with the original pixcel comparison code, need to provide it with a seperate one so that there would be enough pixels to compare with the screenshot.


Once again, this program is not finished and it is a little more than what I bargened for so I cannot complete it on my own.
